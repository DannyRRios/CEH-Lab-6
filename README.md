This is a screenshot of the final step I completed! 

<h2>Description</h2>
This was a huge lab that encompassed a lot of different material within it. First, I bypassed access controls to gain access to the system. This included password cracking and vulnerability exploitation. I then performed different privilege escalation tactics to gain more power over a system. I created and maintained persistency within a target system. After, I had done all of that we then had to hide all the malicious activities that I did. This included applications such as rootkits, steganography and clearing logs.
