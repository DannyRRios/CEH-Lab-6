This is a screenshot of the final step I completed! 

<h2>Description</h2>
This was a huge lab that encompassed a lot of different material within it. First we Bypassed access controls to gain access to the system. This included password cracking and vulnerability exploitation. We then performed different privilege escalation tactics to gain more power over a system. We then created and maintained persistency within a target system. After we had done all of that we then had to hid all the malicious activities that we did. This included applications such as rootkits, steganography and clearing logs.
